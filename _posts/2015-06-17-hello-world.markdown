It's a good time to start blogging. I'm starting a new project in the coming days, finishing my internship for the [INRIA](http://www.inria.fr/en/) and preparing to move in Berlin. So many things to do!

This blog will be mainly about computer science (thoughts, tips and tricks) and my different projects. As code is not something easily maintainable in blog posts, I encourage you to send issues on this blog's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ArmandGrillet/armandgrillet.github.io) if a snippet I wrote is not working anymore. 

I'll try to write at least 1 post/week to have something consistent with no bullshit, just real work, facts, and thoughts.

Have a nice day and see you soon.
