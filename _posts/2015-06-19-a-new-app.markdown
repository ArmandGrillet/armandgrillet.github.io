It's Friday, a good time to start my new app. As hundreds of developer after the WWDC session [Safari Extensibility: Content Blocking and Shared Links](https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2015/?id=511), I'm going to work on an iOS app to block ads on Safari.

This application will be a challenge thus I divided it in many steps:

1. Creating a back-end to download the [updated filters](https://adblockplus.org/subscriptions) and parse them in the correct JSON format.
2. Pushing the JSON files in CloudKit through the new CloudKit JS API.
3. Creating the iOS app, creating the subscriptions model to notify the app when the back-end publish new JSON files.
4. Download these files, apply the filters through the extension model.
5. Creating a good user onboarding experience and support a ton of different languages.
6. Designing the website, the press kit and all the branding of the app.
7. Adding personal whitelists and user preferences connected to iCloud.
8. Creating a Mac extension linked to the iOS app.

8 steps in 3 months, that's a lot. Yet I'm excited about this project thus impossible is nothing.

It will be open-source and free, no bullshit. I will publish my work about it in the coming weeks, stay in tune!
